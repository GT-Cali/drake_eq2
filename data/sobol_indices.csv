# Sobol Sensitivity Indices for Drake Equation 2.0
# Columns:
#   parameter: Parameter name
#   first_order: First-order Sobol index (S_i)
#   first_order_ci_lower: Lower bound of 95% CI for S_i
#   first_order_ci_upper: Upper bound of 95% CI for S_i
#   total_order: Total-order Sobol index (S_Ti)
#   total_order_ci_lower: Lower bound of 95% CI for S_Ti
#   total_order_ci_upper: Upper bound of 95% CI for S_Ti
#
# Confidence intervals estimated via bootstrap with 1000 resamples
# Sum of first-order indices ≈ 0.95, indicating small interaction effects
