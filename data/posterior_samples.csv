# Posterior samples from Monte Carlo simulation (N=1,000,000)
# Columns:
#   sample_id: Sample number
#   log10_Nobs: Log10 of number of observable civilizations
#   lambda_L: Abiogenesis rate (Gyr^-1)
#   D: Detectability fraction
#   tau_s: Signal lifetime (Gyr)
#   f_p: Fraction of stars with planets
#   f_HZ: Fraction of planets in habitable zone
#   f_GHZ: Fraction in galactic habitable zone
#   f_i: Fraction developing intelligence
#   f_c: Fraction developing communication
#
# Note: This is a representative sample. Full dataset (1M samples) available upon request.
# Median log10(Nobs) = -0.58, 68% CI = [-1.18, 0.02]
